# Chipo Moyo Data Analysis Portfolio
Hello, I'm Chipo, an Electrical and Electronics Engineering graduate with a strong analytical background. My engineering education has provided me with a solid foundation in analysis, problem-solving, and project management. I am enthusiastic about applying my technical and analytical skills to the field of data analysis as an entry-level data specialist.

In pursuit of my passion for data analysis, I completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Coursera, providing me with a great introduction to the world of data. Since then, I have continuously honed my skills and knowledge through hands-on projects and by obtaining additional certifications.

In my free time, I immerse myself in exploring the latest data analysis tools and techniques, always on the lookout for opportunities to expand my expertise. I'm motivated by the excitement of uncovering new insights and the satisfaction of leveraging data to solve intricate problems.

This repository was created to showcase my skills, share the projects I've worked on, and track my ongoing progress in the field of Data Analytics. 

Welcome to my data-driven journey!

###Analysing differences in the behavior of casual riders vs paid up members of a cyclistic bike share company. This project was part of my capstone project after my completion of the Google Data Analytics Professional certificate; my first ever project. I will look back at it and see where I started from and use it as reference for how much I will learn as I proceed in my journey to become a data analyst.
